# Vikings: Odin's Passage

Odin's Passage is our take on Frogger - a Viking themed adventure through the high seas. As a Viking, players have to get their ship and travel as far as they can, dodging rocks, settlements, enemy ships, mermaids and fish. The game progresses in difficulty as the game goes on with new obstacles spawning later on in the game at different frequencies. 

Attached is an image of the high score we got during our playtesting during the DIS festival.
